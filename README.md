# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Welcome to SEIR-Flex 09/28 - 4/05 🎉

# Lead Instructors:
- Billie Heidelberg

# Instructional Assistants
- Matt Keane
- Paresh Sharma 

## Learning Objectives (Billie)

* Get to know each other
* Map out the topics and technologies of web development, and identify which we will and will not cover
* List the core expectations of instructors and students
* Determine guiding principles for our class culture
* Review classroom and Zoom ettiquite
* Install necessary software and tools


### Zoom Ettiquite:

* We will keep the Zoom chat muted to avoid unnecessary background noise, but you will be able to unmute yourselves to speak, ask, and answer questions through the day 
* Students are expected to be in the zoom chat with their cameras on throughout the class
* Please keep distractions (pets, children, virtual backgrounds) to a minimum. We are cultivating a professional environment and the way you carry yourself in the class will reflect how you will carry yourself in the workplace
* You will not be penalized if you need to turn your camera off for a minute to take care of something - we are all human!
* We will be using Slack to post and answer questions, not the Zoom chat. We will discuss what each channel (asking for serious help, answering classroom questions, posting memes...) is for shortly


## Welcome & Today's Schedule

### Today's Schedule:
* 5:30 - 6:00  - Welcome to SEIR & Whole Team Intro
* 6:00 - 6:30  - Course Content / Logistics / Policies
* 6:30 - 9:45 -  Installfest/Command Line Interface



## Course Content Overview 
GA's global team has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover and a suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this curriculum based on our own experiences as instructors and the unique features of the job market. We also iterate on this curriculum constantly so technologies and concepts change with each cohort.


### Course Content

> What are some technologies and languages you know of that are involved in web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, Python, Databases).

A non-exhaustive list of technologies we cover...

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* NodeJS/Express
* Database (SQL vs NoSQL Database)
* Python/Django

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you to learn and work in any web development technologies.

### Communicating with Your Instructors
Typically, two instructors will be online each day to run the class. The lead Instructors (Billie) lead the day's lessons together with an IA (Paresh/Matt) helping to run the class. 

If you run into a technical issue that is specific to your code during the lecture, please direct message the IA that's on-camera that day for help, instead of interrupting the lecture.

The instructors are here for you and to help you succeed, but we can't be available to you 24/7. There will be dedicated time for instructors to provide students with support outside of lessons. These are:

- **Study Hall: 9:00PM - 9:45PM Tu/We**
- **Study Hall: 4:00PM - 5:00PM Saturdays**
- **Office Hours: see [Course Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RvTq4bMfzpWi_z5jwzvl9oY2awkimTsHEd_kINB42dM/edit?usp=sharing)**
- **Lab Support**
- **Project Support**

These are times when instructors are available to help you with bugs, answer qu




















































ions or provide advice. 

The goal of this program is to turn you in to a self-sufficient software engineer, so our expectation is that you try to resolve issues on your own as much as possible. We use the remaining time to prepare lessons, grade projects, etc.

However, if you have any questions concerning SEIR, your progress in the course, challenges you are facing, or any other non-technical concerns that you would like to discuss, you are welcome to Slack instructors to set up one-on-one meetings. 

If you reach out via Slack in the evening, the instructor will probably respond by the next day.



### How to Ask for Help?

Asking for help is what students find hardest in SEIR. It is also what ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.

* Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
* **Knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers** are two of the biggest skills you can gain from this class and will be incredibly valuable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

How can we ask for help efficiently?

* Ask a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
* Your instructors and peers won't be able to help you if...
  * The question you're asking isn't constructive
  * It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer. This means taking the following steps...
    1. First, try it yourself
    1. Then, Google it
    1. Then, ask your neighbor
    1. Finally, ask an instructor


## Course Policies (Matt)
### Plagiarism 
General Assembly is not a traditional educational institution, but we share some things in common. We have a plagiarism policy in place to create a healthy classroom culture where students prioritize their learning above all other goals for the duration of the cohort. We create a space where it is 'safe to fail' since 'failure' is such an integral part of the learning process.

* You can't ask external people to do your work
* You must understand your submissions -- if you can't explain them then the assumption is that you plagiarized
* If you collaborate, you have to indicate that you did in a comment on the submission
* You have to comment where you have used the solution branch (if one exists) or if you have used an external resource such as a tutorial - make sure even still you aren't overly reliant on anything. Use a few lines of code at most.
* Make sure you're googling parts of problems rather than the whole problem. The problem solving part of code is the hardest part - make sure you're doing that part too! These aren't research assignments!


### Homework

* You must complete 80% of these homeworks to graduate the class.
* They are graded on a 👍 or 👎 basis -- either they are complete or not. Whether they are complete or not depends on the effort you put in. They don't have to be 100% correct, but you do need to show that you put time into getting the correct answer.
* You will be allowed to resubmit homeworks if you can not finish them that night. They are due One Week from their original date.

### Attendance 
* The IA on duty will take attendance each evening on weekdays and each morning/afternoon when class starts/resumes. You must be on the Zoom call with your camera turned on to be counted present. 
* 3 tardies add up to 1 absence. Only 3 absences total are permitted. If you are absent, please notify the instructors and watch the class recording.
* If you know you will be late or absent ahead of time, please reach out to the IA on duty and let them know. 

## What Is an Immersive Course? (Matt)

Spend two minutes discussing some answers to the following question: **What does it mean to be in an "immersive" environment?**



### There's no winning or losing. 

* This is a non-competitive environment.
* You get out what you put in.
* Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you only.
* Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

### Cooperation & Teamwork. 

* You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding **together** for the next six months.
* Teamwork will be paramount to your success as an SEIR student and beyond. Programming is a teamwork-driven profession. You will learn more from each other than from the instructors!
* Do Not Isolate Yourself During This Time! Every part of the process - from learning the basics to building a resume to filling your portfolio with interesting projects to finding out about new job oppurtunities will be improved by building up a community and team here. 

### Trust the Process - The Cycle of Imitation, Repetition, & Innovation
* ~ 30% of your understanding of the material will come from coding along with the instructor during lectures (imitation). This is the point where most students fall into the panic zone. 
* ~ 40% will come from reinforcing those concepts through the homework and labs (repetition)
* ~ The rest of the 30% will come from building your projects (innovation)

* You are not expected to master any language at the completion of this course. But you will have the skills to learn whatever languages and frameworks you are interested in working with as you enter the professional world.
* Learning coding is the same as playing the piano or painting with oils. Things may not come easy at first, but with time and practice you will begin to familiar with the materials



### Be prepared to work hard. Very hard. 
* The title says it all. Outside of regular class hours, you will spend many hours on homeworks and projects. 


### Re-learning how to learn 

* The **MOST** significant skill you will gain from this course is not proficiency in a particular web framework or programming language, but rather learning how to teach yourself
* You will learn this in an environment that is specifically tailored to this goal, where there is heavy support, instruction designed to structure your self-learning process, and safety to 'fail'.
* We will progressively "back off" over the course of the cohort, encouraging the development of your autonomy as a developer, allowing you to stand strong on your own.

### You will be uncomfortable. Regularly.

* Don't be too hard on yourself.
* You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.
* The first couple days would mostly be review, but we're going to ramp up the rigor and difficulty of the course slowly but surely! 


### Balance.

* This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
* Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

![I was told there would be sleep](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ehenNuS9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ken191h31mp562g66c2w.jpg)

> Consider making a daily schedule for yourself to prioritize what's important to you - time spent with loved ones, working out, preparing healthy meals, etc. Find a balance between the hard work needed for this course and taking care of yourself.

### We will not give up on you.

* Even when you might have given up on yourself!
* None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're passionate about web development, education, your interests, and your professional and personal growth.

### Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience. 

* We have a large body of knowledge, experience, and expertise to draw on from the iterative nature of SEI; SEI has been through hundreds of iterations.
* Each iteration of SEI has been driven in part by student feedback, and for that reason, we rely on your feedback. Please don't hesitate to provide us with feedback!

### Gradual Release of Responsibility 

Being able to ask for help effectively will become increasingly crucial as the course progresses. During the first project, for example, we will be holding office hours throughout the dedicated project days. By the fourth project, however, all support will be conducted using a limited number of tokens per team. Between those two projects, instructors will be placing an increasing onus on the students to solve problems on their own with increasingly limited instructor support -- what we call a "gradual release of responsibility."

While instructors love helping out, we've found that students become stronger developers by learning to solve their own problems. Your instructors won't be following you to your jobs so it's important to develop a sense of self-sufficiency while you're here.

## Growth Mindset

> How do you think GROWTH MINDSET could come into play for a bootcamp student? 

This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done - the first time you've been bad at something in a long time. You will fail and struggle at times, but that's important. We don't succeed despite challenges - we succeed because of challenges.

* Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
* We anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, that's when it is time to really challenge yourself and buckle down. Don't quit! Embrace the fact that the challenge will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.


![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)

Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."
